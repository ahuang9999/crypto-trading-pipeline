# Introduction

Herein, you will be building your very first trading pipeline, sans execution. 
You will build a trading pipeline on Coinbase's BTC - we will use the REST API to simplify construction. The following components will be made:

- Data Ingest - Python, Then Cpp
- Feature Computation - Cpp
- Inference - Python
- Analysis - Python

At the end, you will have a working system that can bring in market data and make predictions, as well as be able to verify how performant 
(or unperformant) those predictions are.
