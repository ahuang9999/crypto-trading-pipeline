# 4 - Analysis

We need to determine if our predictions are actually good. The recommended way to do this is with Correlation with the target.

Change your inference code so you write your output and the target into files. Then, write a Python script that reads both of those and calculates the correlation.

Following this, answer the following questions:


Was your prediction good? If not, why wouldn't it be? How could you improve this?
My prediction wasnt good, the correlation was very low. This is probably because of the feature selection - I could have selected better features.
Correlation = 0.03942576542228851, number of samples = 125, tick = 90 seconds

Are there any design changes that you think could be improved upon here?
Idk.
