# 5 - Optimize

For our last step, we will just port the data ingest logic to Cpp. It is up to you to select an HTTP library, but CPR is recommended.
You should be pybinding all of the C++ together - there should a way in Python to call a function that will use Cpp to call the API, and then also
compute features. Make sure this is tested.

Unit and Integration tests will be required, but can be logically similar to the Python tests. 

Just PR this in (make sure it works) and congrats on finishing the intern project!
