# Step 2 - Feature Computation


We'll now be implementing our feature computation for each tick in Cpp. To attach our Cpp to our Python, we will use Pybind: https://github.com/pybind/pybind11.
The following features will need to be implemented according to our abstract class, tests will be provided. 

The structure of each trade is a tuple<float, float, bool>. The first float is the price, the second is the volume, and the bool is true if the side
of the trade is a buy, and false if it is a sell.

- Number of Trades Tick
- % Buy Trades in Tick
- % Sell Trades in Tick
- Sum of Volume in Last 5 Ticks

Make sure that your features pass the provided C++ tests. There are minor issues with the structure of the tests,
you should consider changing that, but the output values should not be changed. You can change the function declarations if you require, but it is recommended not to change these.

Once you have all 4 of these features complete, we need to add them into the provided function and then set up the pybind so
it can be imported by the Python functions. 

Please also write unit tests for the Python function.
